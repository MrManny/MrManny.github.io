Manny, Mr.

Señor Software Engineer, Austria.

## Private

In my off hours, I am…
- a **gamer**: board games, video games, role-playing games, tabletop games; you name it!
               *Terraforming Mars* is great, by the way. Don't @ me.
- an **archer**: currently shooting with a 28 lbs recurve bow. Sometimes, I also hit things.
- a **mapper**: I spend some time to survey for OpenStreetMap sometimes.
                I am no stranger to geographic information systems.
- an **additive manufacturing** enthusiast: this is slang for "I know 3d printing, and I know some CAD".
- a friend of **animals**: I have had cats and ants
                           ([Messor Barbarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messor_barbarus)) before, currently I have a
                           Labrador.
                           Also, I am usually covered in various canine fluids and fur.
- I go crazy with **Stable Diffusion** way too often. Send help!

## Business

For business stuff, you can probably just check my [LinkedIn] profile, I guess.

Currently doing Product Owner shenanigans at [Dynatrace]. Check them out, we are great!

I know my [GitHub] profile is a bit barren; my main contributions are usually held in private organization
repositories. I swear, I will try to do *something* useful with my GitHub profile some day!

## Language Skills

- German (native, allegedly)
- English (fluent)
- ~~Latin (ferrugineo)~~
- ~~Ancient Greek (πολύ σκουριασμένο)~~
- a plethora of programming and mark-up languages

## Find me

In alphabetical order, you can find me here:

- [GitHub] – even if it's puny right now
- [LinkedIn] – new, and only signed up reluctantly
- [OpenStreetMap]
- [ResearchGate]

I also exist on Reddit in a mainly read-only capacity. `r/netsec` is a great read though!
I am also no stranger to Twitch.
Or Steam.
Or Discord.
But outside that, it's slim pickings. Sorry!
