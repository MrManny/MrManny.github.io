For business stuff, you can probably just check out my [LinkedIn] profile, I guess.

I know my [GitHub] profile is a bit barren; my main contributions are usually held in private organization
repositories. I swear, I will try to do *something* useful with my GitHub profile some day!

### Private

Privately, I amâ€¦
- a **gamer**: board games, video games, role-playing games, tabletop games; you name it!
               *Terraforming Mars* is great, by the way. Don't @ me.
- an **archer**: currently shooting with a 28 lbs recurve bow. Sometimes, I also hit things.
- a **mapper**: I spend some time to survey for OpenStreetMap sometimes.
                I am no stranger to geographic information systems.
- an **additive manufacturing** enthusiast: this is slang for "I know 3d printing, and I know some CAD".
- a friend of **animals**: I have had cats and ants
                           ([Messor Barbarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messor_barbarus)) before, currently I have a
                           Labrador.

### Language Skills

- German (native)
- English (fluent)
- ~~Latin (extremely rusty)~~
- ~~Ancient Greek (extremely rusty)~~
- a plethora of programming and mark-up languages

### Find me

In alphabetical order, you can find me here:

- [GitHub], even if it's puny right now
- [LinkedIn] (new, and only signed up reluctantly)
- [OpenStreetMap]
- [ResearchGate]

I also exist on Reddit in a mainly read-only capacity. `r/netsec` is a great read though!
I am also no stranger to Twitch.
Or Steam.
Or Discord.
But outside that, it's slim pickings. Sorry!
