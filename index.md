Manny, Mr.

Señor Software Engineer and Product Owner (allegedly), Austria.

## Private

In my off hours, I am…
- a **gamer**: board games, video games, role-playing games, tabletop games; you name it!
               *Epic Spell Wars* is great, by the way.
- an **archer**: currently shooting with a 28 lbs recurve bow. Sometimes, I also hit the target.
- a **mapper**: I sometimes spend some time to survey for OpenStreetMap.
                I am no stranger to geographic information systems.
- an **additive manufacturing** enthusiast: this is slang for "I know 3d printing, and I know some CAD".
- a friend of **animals**: I have had cats and ants
                           ([Messor Barbarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messor_barbarus)) before, currently I have a
                           Labrador.
                           Also, I am usually covered in animal hair.
- I go crazy with **Generative Artificial Intelligence** way too often. Send help!

## Business

For business stuff, you can probably just check my [LinkedIn] profile, I guess.

Currently, I am doing Product Owner shenanigans at [Dynatrace].
Check us out, we are great!

I know my [GitHub] profile is a bit barren; my main contributions are mostly in private repositories
all across GitLab, BitBucket, and GitHub.
I swear, I will try to do *something* useful with my GitHub profile… some day!
I have *plenty* of ideas.
Sadly, the same cannot be said about spare time.

## Language Skills

- German (native, allegedly)
- English (fluent)
- ~~Latin (ferrugineo)~~
- ~~Ancient Greek (πολύ σκουριασμένο)~~
- a plethora of programming and mark-up languages

## Find me

In alphabetical order, you can find me here:

- [GitHub] – even if it's puny… right now
- [LinkedIn]
- [OpenStreetMap]
- [ResearchGate] – thinking about closing it eventually as I am no longer active in that community.

I am no stranger to Discord.
Or Twitch.
Or Steam.
But outside that, it's slim pickings. Sorry!
